A repo for my mongoose express project

## Extension of the Grocery Database
After working on a previous project called the Grocery Database for a few weeks, it was decided that we should start from scratch and create another similar project to see if we had enough knowledge of the concepts that we could properly replicate the functionality of the Grocery Database project. You'll see in the code how the database is also themed around groceries like the last project. The differences are that this project includes data entries for employee records as well as groceries, and that this project uses Mongoose.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was for us West-Mec students to demonstrate our knowledge of certain coding concepts that we'd been learning for about a month prior. These concepts are things such as the CRUD operators, Express.js, database monitoring and alteration, and JavaScript as a whole. Aside from that, this project was also used as a means of teaching us students abotu Mongoose.

## Technologies Used and Why
* JavaScript: The main language that most of the projects in West-Mec were coded with. The syntax of the language simply lended itself well to the creation of the project. By this point in the semester we didn't quite know enough about PHP to code the project with that language, so we kept to the language we knew best.
* Node.js: A means of running the project outside of a web browser. With Node.js, we were able to import the many necessary dependencies to make the project functional, as well as we were able to run the project from the console of a Visual Studio Code window to display in a web browser.
* Express.js: This technology enabled the CRUD operators to be completely functional within the project, as well as it was used to retrieve the data we were storing in MongoDB.
* MongoDB: By this point we'd become so well versed in this technology that we'd be remiss if we didn't implement it into this project to properly and securely store the data from our databases. Also, since this project is largely an extension of the Grocery Database project, and that project used MongoDB as well, it only made sense to utilize it again to achieve similar results.
* Mongoose: This new technology was used to simplify interaction with MongoDB by providing a schema-based approach to data modeling, validation, and relationships. Since this was our first time implementing Mongoose into one of our projects, this was also a learning experience.
